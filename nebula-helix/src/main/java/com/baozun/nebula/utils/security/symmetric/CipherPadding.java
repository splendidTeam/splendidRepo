     *     block-ciphered struct} {{@code

     * The size of an instance of a GenericBlockCipher must be a multiple of the block cipher's block length. 
     * 
     * The padding length, which is always present, contributes to the padding, which implies that if:
     *     sizeof(content) + sizeof(MAC) % block_length = 0, 
     * padding has to be (block_length - 1) bytes long, because of the existence of padding_length. 
     * 
     * This make the padding scheme similar (but not quite) to PKCS5Padding, where the padding length is encoded in the padding (and ranges from 1 to block_length). With the SSL scheme, the sizeof(padding) is encoded in the always present padding_length and therefore ranges from 0 to block_length-1.
